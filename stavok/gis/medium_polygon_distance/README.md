# medium_polygon_distance
Repository for Medium article on how to calculate distances between points and polygons.

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in project root to install dependencies.

For this task a dedicated virtual environment `gis` is created.

`kML` is created with Google Earth

`kML` is converted to `GEOJSON`:

- online by [MyGeodata Cloud - GIS Data Warehouse, Converter, Maps](https://mygeodata.cloud/)
- programmatically by [kml2geojson](https://gitlab.com/mrcagney/kml2geojson)
